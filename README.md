# Explore & Learn: Global Data Hub

This iOS application, "Explore & Learn: Global Data Hub," is designed to provide a comprehensive
learning experience for SwiftUI, while exploring and interacting with various global datasets through free APIs.

## Project Overview

The app allows users to explore country information, view weather details, perform currency conversions,
browse image galleries, and interact with maps, all within a modular architecture built using SwiftUI,
MVVM, VIP, and the Coordinator pattern.

## Architecture

The project employs a modular architecture with a clear separation of concerns:

* **Country Module:** Handles the UI and presentation logic for country-related features.
* **Weather Module:** Manages the UI and presentation logic for weather information.
* **Domain Module:** Contains core business logic, use cases (Interactors), entities, and repository protocols.
* **Data Layer Module:** Implements repository classes for data fetching and caching.
* **Network Module:** Manages all API requests.
* **Database Module:** Handles local data persistence.
* **Shared Module:** Contains shared protocols and utilities.
* **App Coordinator:** Manages navigation between modules.

The app utilizes a hybrid architecture, combining MVVM for the UI layer and VIP for the domain layer.
The Coordinator pattern is used for navigation, with each feature module having its own coordinator.
Dependency injection is managed using Swinject.

## Features

* **Country Data Exploration:**
    * List and search countries.
    * View detailed country information (population, currency, languages, etc.).
    * Uses the Rest Countries API.
* **Weather Information:**
    * Display current weather for a country's capital.
    * Uses the OpenWeatherMap API.
* **Currency Conversion:**
    * Convert currencies between countries.
    * Uses the ExchangeRate-API.
* **Image Gallery:**
    * Display images related to a country.
    * Uses the Unsplash API.
* **Interactive Map:**
    * Display country location using MapKit.
* **User Preferences:**
    * Save favorite countries.
    * Theme selection (light/dark).
* **Data Visualization:**
    * Display population data using charts.
* **Offline Functionality:**
    * Cache data for offline viewing.
* **Accessibility:**
    * Designed with accessibility in mind.
* **Error Handling:**
    * Graceful error handling for API requests and network issues.

## Technologies

* SwiftUI
* Combine
* URLSession
* Codable
* MapKit
* Core Data / AppStorage
* Swinject (Dependency Injection)
* Swift Charts

## Getting Started

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [repository URL]
    ```
2.  **Open in Xcode:**
    * Open the `ExploreLearn.xcodeproj` file in Xcode.
3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    * If you are using swift packages, Xcode should download them automatically.
4.  **API Keys:**
    * You may need to obtain API keys from the respective APIs (Rest Countries,
      OpenWeatherMap, Unsplash, ExchangeRate-API) and configure them in the appropriate modules.
5.  **Build and Run:**
    * Select a simulator or connected device and run the application.

## Modular Architecture

The project is structured into distinct modules to enhance maintainability and testability:

* **CountryModule:** Contains views, view models, and the coordinator for country-related features.
* **WeatherModule:** Contains views, view models, and the coordinator for weather-related features.
* **DomainModule:** Encapsulates the core business logic, use cases (Interactors), entities,
    and repository protocols.
* **DataLayerModule:** Provides concrete implementations of repositories for data fetching and caching.
* **NetworkModule:** Abstracts network requests and API interactions.
* **DatabaseModule:** Manages local data persistence using Core Data or AppStorage.
* **SharedModule:** Contains shared protocols, extensions, and utility classes.
* **AppCoordinator:** Orchestrates navigation between modules.

## Dependency Injection

Swinject is used for dependency injection to manage dependencies between modules and promote loose coupling.

## Testing

The project is designed with testability in mind. Unit tests should be written for view models,
interactors, presenters, repositories, and data sources.
